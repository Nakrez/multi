* README

Multi is a cross compilation software. It will try to compile your C project
on different computer across the network (only gcc, no cross compilation
supported for now). Every computer has to run a multi deamon to accept the
connection from the multi client.

Multi is not a compiler it only preprocess the source code using gcc and
send it the client that will compile it into an object file and send it back
to the client. For all compilation purpose multi uses an external compiler
(gcc for now, more supported soon). Multi is also compatible with automake and
cmake.

* BUILD

Build multi is very simple. No external library is needed.
Multi uses CMAKE build system so you will need to have it installed on your
computer.

To build multi you have to do this :

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

make

* USE

The build step would have generated you 2 binaries : multi and multid
multi is the client.
multi-server is the server.

To launch a server just do the following command on a shell

./multi-server --start

To launch a client you just have to invoke multi as if you were invoking gcc
binary. The client will take care of the rest.

If something goes wrong between the client and the server, or no server can be
reached, multi will try to compile locally your file;

If you want to change the default port (8216) of the server or the client
just export the variable MULTI_PORT before launching the server or the client.
On bash you just have to do:

export MULTI_PORT=4321

For example to use port 4321
